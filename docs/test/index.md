This repository is an experimental CLI to play [SpaceTraders](https://docs.spacetraders.io/).

This documentation reflects findings and learnings of the game as it's not fully documented on the 
[official Wiki](https://github.com/SpaceTradersAPI/api-docs/wiki) as the game is meant to be 
discovered and learned about while playing.

The purpose of this documentation is to interpolate some of the aspects of the game with findings and trying to 
explore and explain mechanics of how I'm playing the game.
